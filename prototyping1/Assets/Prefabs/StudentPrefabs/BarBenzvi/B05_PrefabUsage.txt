The MonsterSlime prefabs can be used to activate QTEs on collision with the player
The big MonsterSlime prefab will use the more challenging QTE prefab (QuickTimeEventMedium), but you could simply change this on the objects in your scene

The QuickTimeEvent prefabs should pretty much handle themselves, and should not be manually placed in your scene.

All of these prefabs use or call the QTE events in B05_EventManager. If you want to use this feature, you will likely want to hook into some of these events.
You could also use some of the components I already made, such as B05_DamagePlayerOnQTEFailed or B05_QTETrigger
