Hello thanks for using my simple healing feature.

There is a Norm and Max health pickup, Norm lets you choose how much health to give the player upon pickup, Max fills the health to max.

There is a Regen prefab that if placed in level will allow the player to regenerate health, don't use regen and hearts at the same time it breaks things and I don't see the reason to.

There are 2 new tilemaps, DepthOfField and HealingWater. DepthOfField is another object layer with max order so you can walk behind things as the player such as the trees in my level, and HealingWater creates a regen pool for the player to rest in.

Future Plans: (Depending on user feedback and time I have)
-SFX/VFX/Particles for healing and damage
-Bloodborn combat (you can gain back health lost for a short time, by damaging enemies)
