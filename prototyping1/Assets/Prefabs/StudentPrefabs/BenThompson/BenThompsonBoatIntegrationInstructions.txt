UI Prefabs:
- BenThompsonBoatChargeIndicatorBorder prefab should be placed inside of your GameHandlerCanvas/Canvas object as a child.
  This is the prefab that allows the charging indicator to appear when the player is charging up their movement.

Tilemap Prefabs:
- Both the TilemapShoreline and TilemapWater prefabs should be children of your Grid object that contains your tilemaps.
- These are both empty tilemaps which you can edit to produce the water/shoreline boundaries required for smooth integration
  of the boat into your level.

- The water tilemap should contain water tiles that the player can't walk on but the boat can move on.
- The shoreline tilemap should contain tiles that the player can walk on but the boat cannot drive on.

- I recommend using the sand tile for the shoreline and placing tiles wherever your grass meets the water for a nice beach effect.

Boat and Dock Prefabs:
- The dock is an object that should be lined up nicely along a shore line.
- The blue section of the dock is where the boat is allowed to park, and the tiles underneath this section should be on the water tilemap. 
- IMPORTANT: The tiles underneath the dock need to be on the shoreline tilemap in order for the player to walk on the dock and the boat to not
	     be able to drive through the dock. I suggest using the brown dirt as the underlying tile image so that it matches nicely with the dock
             if you don't perfectly line it up. 

- The boat prefab is simply an object that can be placed in the scene as a normal object would be.
- IMPORTANT: If you place a boat inside a dock and intend the player to be able to use that boat when they first get on the dock,
  	     PLEASE, PLEASE remember to edit the dock object and inside the BenThompson_DockingBehavior component place the boat
	     that is parked in the dock's collider inside the Docked Boat field. This will ensure that the player is able to interact
	     with the parked boat in the dock when it first starts up.

BenThompsonBoatControlsSceneHandler Prefab
- This assists in reseting the controls when you come from a new scene due to the underlying code used to make the prompts appear.
  Just place it inside your scene and it will work its magic as you come and go.
