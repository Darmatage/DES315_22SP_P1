The Metronome Controller restricts movement for the player so that they may only move to the beat of a metronome.

Integration steps:

1. Replace PlayerMove script with MetronomePlayerController on the Player object.

2. Add a MetronomeController prefab into your scene.

3. Add a MetronomeMarker prefab and a StatusText prefab as a child of the Canvas object.

Enjoy! In the future this will be consolidated to one prefab.
