The Metronome Controller restricts movement for the player so that they may only move to the beat of a metronome.

Integration steps:

1. Add a MetronomeController prefab to your scene. 

You're all done!

You can tweak the number of bars as well as the threshold for "perfect" and "good" beats.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

The MetronomeController will replace the player controller with a new one that overrides some functions. So, if you have
any sort of modified player controller, you may get conflicts.
