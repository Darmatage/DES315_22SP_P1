Attach the Hookshot prefab under the player.
Give the hookshot component the player tag.
For any object that you want to grapple onto, change the layer to "HookShot_Wall".
Under the hookshot component, there is a variable called "HookShot_Wall". This variable will cause you to grapple onto any object with the layer you select. I would change this to the layer "HookShot_Wall".

There are three variables you can change.
Hookshot_speed: How fast the player will be dragged to a direction after grappling onto a wall.
Hookshot_launch_speed: How fast the hookshot will go after initially launching it.
Hookshot_distance: How far the hookshot will go.
