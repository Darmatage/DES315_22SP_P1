Discord - Daeun Jeong#3644

//How to use
1. Add "DaeunJeong_MysteriousChest" into your scene.
2. Drag and drop the "Canvas" to the script of the chest.

//Optional
+) if you toggle "Should Spawn Switch", then only one of the chests will give you the switch.
And there will be no switch on the scene.

+) You can add and remove whatever you want, on the list "Things Can Get From Chest".
But you cannot add the door, it will be automatically deleted from the chest.

+) Pickups works when there is a chest in the scene.
For now, the health pickup works with Wonju's player.

//Warning
* There will be problems if there's null reference on the script, or if there's nothing in the list.
