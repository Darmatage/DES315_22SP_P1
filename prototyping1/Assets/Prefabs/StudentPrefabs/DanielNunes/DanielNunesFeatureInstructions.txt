DanielNunes_Cannon:
-The cannon should just be dragged into the scene. However, make sure it's lined up properly by changing the X and Y
of its transform when it's in the scene. (i.e. x = 4.5, y = 8.5 instead of x = 4.6800007, y = 8.4450003). If you don't
do this, the movement of the cannon will be off when pushing and pulling.

DanielNunes_AngledPipe:
-Same as the cannon. Make sure it's lined up properly when dropping it into the scene. Also, keep the angle on 90-degree
intervals (i.e. 0, 90, 180, 270).

DanielNunes_Crate:
-Again, like the other two: make sure it's lined up properly when dropping it into the scene.


For making the sand tiles that sink the cannon, create a tilemap called "TilemapSand" in the Grid object in the hierarchy,
give it a TilemapCollider2D component, then a CompositeCollider2D component (set Geometry type to "Polygons" and set
IsTrigger to true), and a Rigidbody2D (freezing x and y position and z rotation in the Constraints). Then, of course, paint
the tiles onto the level as you would any other tilemap.
