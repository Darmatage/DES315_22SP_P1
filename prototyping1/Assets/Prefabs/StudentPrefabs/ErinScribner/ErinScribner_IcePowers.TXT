Hello! This file will explain how to set up my ice power feature.

1) Put ErinScribner_PlaceBlock inside of your level. Make sure
   its position is (0,0,0) for both this and its attached art asset. 

2) You will see that PlaceBlock has a script 
   called ErinScribner_IcePowers. I'll go over what each of the 
   public variables do:
   Ice Block            -> The attached art asset of the ice block
   Max Num              -> The max number of times a player can 
                           use the ice block power
   Destructable Tilemap -> The tile layer that the ice power is 
                           able to detroy
   Range Destroy        -> How many blocks can the ice destroy around
                           it? (I recommend keeping this set to 1 or 2)

Lastly, when a player presses I, they will use their ice powers. 
And that's it! If you run into any issues, or have suggestions on
how to improve this feature, please let me know.
