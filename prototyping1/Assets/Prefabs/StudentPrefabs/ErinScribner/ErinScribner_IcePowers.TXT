Hello! This file will explain how to set up my ice power feature.

1) Put ErinScribner_PlaceBlock inside of your level. Make sure
   its position is (0,0,0)

2) Place ErinScribner_IceLayer tile layer under Grid with all of
   the other tile layers. IMPORTANT: Make sure ErinScribner_IceLayer
   has a higher layer number then whichever layer you want the ice
   to cover. Ex: setting lava layer to 5, and IceLayer to 6 

3) When you click on ErinScribner_PlaceBlock, you will see that 
   there is a script attached called ErinScribner_PaintTile. I'll
   go over what each of the variables do:
   
   Paint Tilemap: An empty tile layer that you want the ice on. This is
                  where ErinScribner_IceLayer goes.
   
   Range Tilemap: This is where you'd put whichever layer you'd like 
                  ice to be able to cover

   Range Paint:   How far can the ice can go

   Can Paint:     A boolean that states whether ice can appear or not.
          
   Heal:          How much hp can the character heal? 
  
   Damage Time:   How quickly does the player heal from taking damage? 

   Num Power  :   How many times the player can use their ice powers 
                  before having to recharge

   Recharge Speed:How quickly does the player recharge their ice power

1/26/2022 Notice: As of the date listed, the player is able to shoot 
                  ice around them by pressing "I". The player also 
                  heals on the ice closest to them. The ice powers
                  also need to recharge after a given time & number of
                  uses.
