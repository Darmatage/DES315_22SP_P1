Overview: A short ranged attack that will instantly destory an enemy.

Public Variables: These are going to change soon
	- Damage: This is redundent as now the attack just destorys any enemy in one hit
	- Range: This currently doesn't affect anything but will soon have a function
	- Delete Fire Delay: how long the projectile lasts in the world
	Will soon have a cooldown variable to control

Description:
The mechanic is added into the game via adding the FireBlastTool Prefab into the 
game world. All you have to do is drag it into play. You can set the projectile life
in the public variables. In fact if you wanted to. You can instead instantiate anything 
with the fire blast tool by replacing the prefab in the public variables with any
other prefab.

You spawn in the projectile with either the F key or right click, it will be rotate towards the mouse.

Future Plans:
	- Have the length work.
	- Have a public cooldown variable.
	- Add pushback into the mechanic.
