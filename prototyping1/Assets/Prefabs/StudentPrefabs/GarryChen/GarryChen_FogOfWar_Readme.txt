Hello. Welcome to Garry Chen's Fog of War. Following steps will show how to integrate the feature to your project:

. Add GarryChen_FogOfWarCanvas to GameHandlerCanvas

. Make sure Canvas size is big enough to cover your level

. Add GarryChen_FogOfWarMainCamera and GarryChen_FogOfWarSecondaryCamera to the scene

. Replace Player with GarryChen_FogOfWarPlayer.

. Player vision range can be change by modifing the scale of both GarryChen_FogOfWarPlayer and GarryChen_FogOfWarPlayerVisionSecondary (under player).
