HowToUse

1) Drop the feature into the scene
2) In the Inspector Panel there are several settings:
   a. Y_dist - distance to travel in the y direction (positive value)
   b. X_dist - distance to travel in the x direction (positive value)
   c. Y_center - starting position of disk in y direction
   d. X_center - starting position of disk in x direction
   e. Speed - Movement speed of the disk
   f. Reverse_dir - change direction of disk (for both linear and circular movement)
   g. Damage - Damage to the player value
   h. Y_dir - Set disk to move on the y-axis
   i. X_dir - Set disk to move on the x-axis
   j. Reverse_diagonal_dir - Change diagonal movement from
      bottom left/top right to bottom right/top left
   k. circle_mode - moves disk in circle
   l. radial_speed - circular speed of disk
   m. radius - radius of circle to move about
3) To have diagonal movement, check both Y_dir and X_dir 
   and have X_dist and Y_dist be the same value
4) Disks must move in some direction with some speed
5) The "center" values is where the disk will start and 
   the "distance" values tell it how much to move from that 
   position e.g. if distance is set to 7 and center is 3, the
   disk will start at 3 and move +/- 3.5, meaning it will go from
   6.5 to -0.5.
6) This feature requires the user to measure the distances and 
   to know where they want the disk to start.
7) Diagonal movement can get pretty wild if X_dist and Y_dist are not the same
