HowToUse

1) Drop the feature into the scene
2) In the Inspector Panel there are several settings:
   a. Y_dist - distance to travel in the y direction
   b. X_dist - distance to travel in the x direction
   c. Y_center - midpoint of the Y_dist traveled
   d. X_center - midpoint of the X_dist traveled
   e. Speed - Movement speed of the disk
   f. Reverse_dir - change direction of disk
   g. Damage - Damage to the player value
   h. Y_dir - Set disk to move on the y-axis
   i. X_dir - Set disk to move on the x-axis
   j. Reverse_diagonal_dir - Change diagonal movement from
      bottom left/top right to bottom right/top left
3) To have diagonal movement, check both Y_dir and X_dir
4) Disks must move in some direction with some speed
5) The "center" values is where the disk will start and 
   the "distance" values tell it how much to move from that 
   position e.g. if distance is set to 7 and center is 3, the
   disk will start at 3 and move +/- 3.5, meaning it will go from
   6.5 to -0.5.
6) This feature requires the user to measure the distances and 
   to know where they want the disk to start.
