Overview: Enemy will multiply a # of times based on programmer input

Public Variables:
  - health: CURRENTLY NOT WORKING CORRECTLY (WILL BE REMOVED SOON)
  - multiplications: # of Multiplications the FIRST ENEMY will do
  - time_between_multiplications: Time (in seconds) between each multiplication
  - enemy_object: The enemy object (WILL BE REMOVED SOON)
  - enemy_art: The artwork of the enemy (WILL BE REWORKED SOON)

In-Depth Description:
  Enemy w/MultiplyEnemy script will make smaller copies of itself. Each copy will
have HALF the health of the original, HALF the amount of multiplications of the
original, and will be smaller than its parent. Each version of the enemy will spawn 
one(1) enemy per split.

Future Change(s)/Plan(s):
  1) Remove "health" variable. Found better way to get the information
  2) Remove the "enemy_object" variable. Found better way to get the information
  3) Have a public color variable so enemy will flash said color before multiplying
  4) Make it so "enemy_art" isn't needed, but will still be an option. "enemy_art" is 
     used to make the sprite change color due to the enemies having a child component
     that is holding a Renderer.
