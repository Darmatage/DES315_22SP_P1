Overview: Enemy will multiply a # of times based on programmer input

Public Variables:
  - multiplications: # of Multiplications the FIRST ENEMY will do
  - time_between_multiplications: Time (in seconds) between each multiplication

In-Depth Description:
  Enemy w/MultiplyEnemy script will make smaller copies of itself. Each copy will
have HALF the health of the original, HALF the amount of multiplications of the
original, and will be smaller than its parent. Each version of the enemy will spawn 
one(1) enemy per split.

Future Change(s)/Plan(s):
  1) Have a public color variable so enemy will flash said color before multiplying
