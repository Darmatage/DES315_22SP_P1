Hey! So you want to grab and throw stuff huh?

Three easy steps:
 - Add 'JakobShumway_grabObject' to your player.
 - Add a 'Rigidbody2D' to the object you want thrown.
 - Preface the object with 'GRAB_'.

My prefab is not required to grab/throw objects, but I have already completed the last two steps.

I would also highly recommend giving your object friction.
