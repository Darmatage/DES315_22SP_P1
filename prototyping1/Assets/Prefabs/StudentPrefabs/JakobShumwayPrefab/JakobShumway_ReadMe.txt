Hey! So you want to grab and throw stuff huh?

Three easy steps:
 - Add 'JakobShumway_grabObject' to your player.
 - Add a 'Rigidbody2D' to the object you want thrown.
 - Preface the object with 'GRAB_'.

 - IF you want your object to deal damage to enemies when thrown, add 'JakobShumway_impactDamage' to the object you want thrown.

Additional notes:
 - My prefab box is not required to grab/throw objects.
 - I would highly recommend giving your object friction.
 - The prefabs in personalUse are not for you.
