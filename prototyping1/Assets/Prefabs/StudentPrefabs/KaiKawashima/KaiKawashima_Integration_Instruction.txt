Components required: 
- The bucket prefab
- The bush prefab
- A layer of tiles with the water tag
- Water Bucket script 

Instruction:
- The bucket prefab is good to go on its own. Place it down in the level and the player can interact with it.
- The bush prefab is also able to be placed in the level on its own. The animator may need to be set.
- Add a layer tilemap with the water tag. This is the area that the player can get water after they have picked up a bucket
- Add the water bucket script to the player 
- Each of the scripts have a "Key To Interact". This is the key the player presses to interact with the respective component. (you'll likely want lowercase)
