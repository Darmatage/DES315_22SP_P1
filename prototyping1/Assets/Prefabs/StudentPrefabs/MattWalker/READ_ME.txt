To use Destructible Objects:

Place a "DestructibleObject" prefab in the scene.
You can replace the sprite, so the object looks like whatever you want it to be!  See "Object Sprite" variable below

Public Variables:
---------------------------------
1. "Contained Object" - This GameObject will be dropped (instantiated) when the DestructibleObject is destroyed.
	                    It can be any gameobject prefeb (item pickup, enemy, etc)
2. "Prompt Object UI" - don't change this
3. "Explosion Prefab" - don't change this, unless you want a different explosion animation
4. "Object Sprite"    - This sprite used for this object (default is a wooden crate)
