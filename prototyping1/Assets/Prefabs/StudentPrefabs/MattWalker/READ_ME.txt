To use Destructible Objects:

Place a "DestructibleObject" prefab in the scene.
You can replace the sprite, so the object looks like whatever you want it to be!

Public Variables:
"Contained Object" - This GameObject will be dropped (instantiated) when the DestructibleObject is destroyed.
	The object can be a pickup, enemy, etc.
"Prompt Object UI" - don't change this
"Explosion Prefab" - don't change this, unless you want a different explosion animation
