HOW TO:
The Slowing Slimes include 2 major features, the slimes and the boots.
The slimes, when placed in a leve, will chase the object with the player tag and slow them down.
The Boots are a script that are attached to the player. When attached, the slimes will spawn an image of themselves on the boots to indicate slowness.
