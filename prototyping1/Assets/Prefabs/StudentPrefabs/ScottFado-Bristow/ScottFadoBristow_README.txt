HOW TO:
The Slowing Slimes include 2 major features, the slimes and the boots.
The MonsterSlimes, when placed in a leve, will chase the object with the player tag and slow them down.
The player prefab features a script called Boots. The slimes look for this script when attatching to an object.
The SmallAttatchedSlime prefab is automaticaly spawned on the player when a slime touches the player and slows them.
If you want to use your own player, just attatch the ScottFadoBristow_SlimeBoots to your player. Make sure to set the SmallAttachedSlime prefab in the scripts variables.

You can remove slimes from the player by wiggling left and right
